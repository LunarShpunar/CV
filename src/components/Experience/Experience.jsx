                I am exploring the field of backend development, focusing on learning server-side programming, database management, and API design. Currently,
                I am building foundational skills in ะก++ and working on small projects to deepen my understanding of scalable and efficient backend systems.
                As a self-starter, I enjoy learning independently and applying new knowledge to practical challenges. 
                My goal is to grow as a developer and deliver high-quality solutions in the future.
